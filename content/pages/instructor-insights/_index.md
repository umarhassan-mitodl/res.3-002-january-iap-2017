## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _RES.3-002 Collaborative Design and Creative Expression with Arduino Microcontrollers_ as it was taught by Kyle Keane and Andrew Ringler in IAP 2017.

This course was a 9-day hands-on workshop about collaboration, design, and electronics prototyping. Participants learned about microcontroller programming using Arduino, collaborative software development using GitHub, solderless electronics prototyping, electronic sensors, rapid prototyping, and small team management.

This course was offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.

## Course Outcomes

- Learn about microcontroller programming using Arduino
- Become familiar with collaborative software development using GitHub
- Explore solderless electronics prototyping
- Practice rapid prototyping
- Learn about small team management

## Instructor Insights

{{< quote "On the first day of the workshop, we talk explicitly about how the point of being together in this shared space is for participants to find things that excite them, for them to share this excitement with others, and to feel vulnerable." "— Kyle Keane and Andrew Ringler" >}}

## How Student Time Was Spent

During this nine-day workshop, students were expected to spend 27 hours in the class and optional project time out of the class, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Met 4–5 times per week for 3 hours per session; 9 sessions total.
- Workshop sessions were hands-on, with participants working in small teams to design and build electronics projects using open-source microprocessors.

### Out of Class (Optional)

Some participants borrowed materials, such as sensors, to work on their projects outside of class.
