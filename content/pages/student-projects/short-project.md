## Overview

Students form groups of two to four and work for six hours on a small project. We help facilitate this by discussing techniques for collaborative design, guiding the class in an improv activity, lead a brainstorming activity for the whole class to help students identify collaborators, allow students ample time to self-organize into teams. Students then have 6 hours of class time to develop an idea for a small interactive project with Arduino, to create the project, to discover if they like their teammates, and to learn about all the technical skills that will be needed on a team to succeed. Each group does a short presentation for the entire class and talks about their project, but most importantly talks about what they learned.

It may be helpful to keep a check on the groups and have them demonstrate their progress every occasionally and help them with debugging code or hardware. There may be times more often than once when groups do not seem to be making any progress with particular aspects of their project due to lack of knowledge in some technical domain or because the scope of the project is too ambitious. It could be helpful to help them redefine the scope of the project and to break it down into simpler modules that they can tackle one at a time and then integrate altogether.
